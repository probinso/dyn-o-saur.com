I love doing competitions because of their diverse learning and collaborative opportunities under time constraints.
 Here I provide information on some of the competitions I've participated in. <!--I will continue adding entries to this page, as I fabricate time. -->

  <p><strong>Pacific Rim Regional Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition</strong> --  March 2012</p>
  <p>
    The Pacific Rim Regional Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) is a security defense competition lasting two days. Your team of eight is given a room of computers with an unknown state of security. The goal is to secure the provided systems, while efficiently performing general operational business tasks. The catch is that during the whole competition, trained security specialists are breaking into your systems and creating new and interesting security holes. The teams also are required to give security presentations, and write security policies. In the March 2012 competition, my team placed fourth of eleven.

The prompt for 2012 was as follows.
<p style="margin-left:20px;margin-right:20px;padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;background-color:#FFFFFF;"> “Problem B was written by Catherine Roberts, and required contestants to analyze boat and camping trips down the Big Long River… River trips all start at First Launch and exit the river at Final Exit, 225 miles downstream. Passengers take either oar- powered rubber rafts, which travel on average 4 mph or motorized boats, which travel on average 8 mph. The trips range from 6 to 18 nights of camping on the river, start to finish. The government agency responsible for managing this river wants every trip to enjoy a wilderness experience, with minimal contact with other groups of boats on the river. Currently, X trips travel down the Big Long River each year during a six month period (the rest of the year it is too cold for river trips). There are Y camp sites on the Big Long River, distributed fairly uniformly throughout the river corridor... determine how they might schedule an optimal mix of trips, of varying duration (measured in nights on the river) and propulsion (motor or oar) that will utilize the campsites in the best way possible. In other words, how many more boat trips could be added to the Big Long River's rafting season? The river managers have hired you to advise them on ways in which to develop the best schedule and on ways in which to determine the carrying capacity of the river, remembering that no two sets of campers can occupy the same site at the same time. In addition to your one page summary sheet, prepare a one page memo to the managers of the river describing your key findings.”
