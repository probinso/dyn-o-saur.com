  <strong>Color Pollution Course</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-robinson-95392010">Tim Robinson</a> and I started a project developing materials to help people reason, visualize, and communicate about light and color science. Our core audience includes astronomers, policy makers, light engineers, image processors, and data analysts.

  <br />
  Currently, our largest project is developing tools that reduce the cost of obtaining spectral profiles for light sources, by extracting useful features from images taken by consumer grade cameras. This is an effort to educate people about light pollutions effects on systems of ecology and economy.

  <br />
  In this work I have also expanded to providing consulting and tutoring services on programming and support tools to industry scientists.
