    <strong>PPAML Evaluator Tools</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    While at Galois, I developed <strong>peval</strong> to support our work for DARPA's PPAML program. The primary goal of this work was to stabalize and standardize a submission evaluation workflow over several compilers for in-development programming languages and solutions to challenge problems written in each of these languages.

  <strong>Cryptographic Accountabilibuddy Daemon</strong>
</p>
<p>
  This is a project is in it's early stages.
  It's goal is to provide a simple daemon that grants access to virtual 'stable system vectors' for distributed systems.
  Stable system vectors are usually a mechanism for reliably reconstructing passwords for single systems as to avoid storing 'plain text' passwords on at-risk mediums (like the system's own hard drive).
  By using shared secrets cryptography, we can escalate our threat model to require takeover of a majority share of a specific computer network, instead of just seizure of a single computer to compromise security.
  This idea provides an alternative approach to password storage than the common 'networked password manager'.

  <strong>Acountabilibuddy Crypto Network</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The goal of this project is to escalate the protected threat model of systems who share a common network.
  We normally think of physical access as a 'game over' sort of problem.
  The acountabilibuddy crypto network will allow your system to exercise a set of trusted peers to produce your cryptographic keys.
  If someone were to remove your machine from its physical network, they would be unable to retrieve your sensitive data.
  This project is in very early stages and has no sharable history yet.

  <strong>Fully Homomorphic Encryption</strong>
</p>
<p>
  This project is an implementation of a fully homomorphic encryption system using Python. As this was a learning exercise, we do not focus on efficientcy.
  This cryptography model allows users to apply arbitrary circuit operations over encrypted data without decrypting it.
<!--  The presentation of this system enables a word-count over encrypted text. -->
<!--  For this project we are using Hadoop's map-reduce over a distributed file system. -->
<!--  The goal and end product is to provide an educational code base, to enable more to understand and learn about this complex field. -->

    <strong>Concurrent Elliptic Curve Cryptography</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    This project developed a parallel Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) module in Erlang.
    The goal was to develop fast methods in ECC that could be parallelized without general loss of security.
    I learned Erlang for this project for its friendly concurrency and bit-manipulation language features.

  <strong>TwixT AI</strong>
</p>
<p>
  TwixT is a two player board game where each player competes to build a fence across the board.
  <!--This game has recieved little attention as an artificial intelligence (AI) project. -->
  <!--Although the original idea was to develop a reasonable AI for Twixt, this project has temporarily migrated towards forming a solid UI with easy AI plugin features. -->
  This project goal provides a solid UI with easy AI plug-in features.
  I hope with this project to encourage others to participate in writing AIs for competition.

<p><strong>AdaRailz</strong></p>
<p>
  AdaRailz was a senior project hosted by WWU.
  Our department build a model train set and had three sets of students contribute to a waterfall development model over three academic quarters.
  One team did specifications analysis, the second team did design development, and I participated in the implementation team.
  The project specification was to design a safe and concurrent Model Train control system.
Our team implemented human interface tools, systems safety to prevent collisions and derailments, and enabled critical section reservations.
  This project was written in Ada.

<p><strong>Petrographic Database</strong></p>
<p>
  I participated in a group project to design a petrographic database, to aid in mineral identification in rock samples, for the WWU Geology department.
  The project provided an interface that allowed users to screen and score minerals by their measurable attributes.
  My greatest influence in the project was developing the mineral scoring algorithm.
  Having never taken a geology course, I found this project enforcing my interdisciplinary communication skills.
  The foundations that our team laid are now being passed on as a vehicle for graduate research.
