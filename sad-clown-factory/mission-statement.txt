<p />
There is a democratizing force in this world, a feeling that every human expiriences at some point in their life; the ever crushing, crippling, and debilitating force of <br />'Work Related Depression'. 

<p />
We are looking for:
<ul>
  <li> those comming from oppressive work environment </li>
  <li> lack of confidence, from inability to find work </li>
  <li> feelings of underappreciation or underutilization </li>
  <li> being trapped in your employment situation, regardless of reason </li>
</ul>

<p />
We hope to collect and share your sadness. 

<p />
We are asking for you to create images of sad clowns. Please only work on these pieces while depressed about work. We ask that you do not include your profession or any personally identifiable information in your image.
