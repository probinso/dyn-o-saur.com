There is a democratizing force in this world, a feeling that every human expiriences at some point in their life; the ever crushing, crippling, and debilitating force of sadness.

<p />
We are looking for people:
<ul>
  <li> who feel broken </li>
  <li> without the energy to fight </li>
  <li> with unhapiness and depression </li>
  <li> feeling of being trapped </li>
</ul>

<p />
We hope to collect your sadness, and force it onto others.

<p />
We are asking for you to create images of sad clowns. Please only work on these pieces while sad or depressed. We ask that you do not include personally identifiable information in your image.
